**OIBSIP Internship Tasks**

This repository contains all the tasks I completed during my virtual internship at Oasis Infobyte under the OIBSIP (Oasis Infobyte Summer Internship Program).

**Internship Domain**: Data Science  
**Internship Duration**: 5th July 2025 – 15th August 2025

**Tasks Completed**

**Task 1: Iris Flower Classification**
I built a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species using petal and sepal measurements.
I used logistic regression and evaluated the model’s performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

**Task 2: Unemployment Analysis** 
I worked on visualizing and analyzing unemployment data of India.
I used Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to understand patterns and trends in unemployment rates across states and time.

**My Experience**

I used ChatGPT to guide me through certain parts of the tasks when I was stuck or needed clarification.
It helped me understand the concepts better and stay on track.
Every task i have done , I understand all of them . I’ve learned a lot about data visualization, basic machine learning, and model evaluation during this internship.

**Special Thanks**

I’m thankful to Oasis Infobyte for giving me this opportunity to gain practical experience and improve my data science skills.
